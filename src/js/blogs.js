    content: `The Kalahari Desert is a huge area of land that extends from the Northern Cape of South Africa up into Botswana and Namibia. It is believed to be some 500 million years old and is home to a number of fossils that have fascinated researchers for decades. It measures almost a million square kilometres. Despite being arid, with only a small amount of rainfall every year, the Kalahari Desert is actually home to a huge variety of plants and animals.Flora includes Acacia trees, Kiwano trees, short grasses, and the famous Baobab Tree. Of course, because the area of this desert is so extensive, the vegetation and biomes change somewhat from one area to the next. For instance, the centre of the Kalahari experiences a lot more rainfall and is, therefore, a lot more lush and fertile.In terms of the actual landscape, the desert is generally undulatig but lacking major topographical features.<h3>Wild Life</h3> There are little kopjes that are made from bedrock and rise out of the sand inconspicuously. The animals of the Kalahari include many different types of antelope, as well as jackals, hyena, crocodiles, elephants, giraffes, baboons, leopards, cheetahs, lions, and more. The birdlife is extensive, making the Kalahari Desert fabulous for bird-watchers. The best time to visit the Kalahari Desert is during the cooler seasons, which extend from April to September. Summers (between about December and March) are scorching, making them very tiring and somewhat uncomfortable. In addition, the animals tend to lay low during the heat of the African summer, retreating into shaded spots and preferring to come out of hiding only in the early mornings or evenings. Summer days can reach highs of up to 45 degrees Celsius and, occasionally, even hotter. The Kalahari Desert is ideal for game viewing. There are many game reserves within the desert, each of which runs its own conservation initiatives and showcases its own magnificent variety of hunters, prey and birds. These game reserves include Tswalu Kalahari, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. There are a number of places to stay within the Kalahari Desert, including guesthouses, lodges, bush camps and camping grounds. The San cultural villages give an accurate account of the lives and customs of an ancient people that once lived in the desert; establishing their home in this tough terrain and surviving off of the land. Learning about these people gives visitors an incredible insight into the history, culture and heritage of South Africa.In addition to game drives, the Kalahari Desert is a fabulous retreat for photographers that are looking for exquisite photo opportunities. Stretches of sand, clear blue skies, the mysterious arms of the Baobab Tree and the unique selection of animals, big and small, ensure that you are able to capture exquisite memories to last a lifetime.`,

    title: "Is Crypto the future?",
    img: "img2.jpg",
    content: `Bitcoin is a good indicator of the crypto market in general, because it’s the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the rest of the market tends to follow its trends. Bitcoin’s price had a wild ride in 2021, and in November set another new all-time high price when it went over $68,000. This latest record high follows previous high points over $60,000 in April and October, as well as a summer drop to less than $30,000 in July. This volatility is a big part of why experts recommend keeping your crypto investments to less than 5% of your portfolio to begin with. But how high will Bitcoin go? Plenty of experts say it’s only a matter of when, not if, it Bitcoin hits $100,000. Bitcoin’s past may provide some clues as to what to expect looking forward, according to Kiana Danial, author of “Cryptocurrency Investing for Dummies.” Danial says there have been plenty of huge spikes followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin’s price since 2011. “What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility short-term and growth long-term.”
    <h4>What Bitcoin price volatility means for investors</h4>Bitcoin’s volatility is more reason for investors to play a steady long game. If you’re buying for long-term growth potential, then don’t worry about short-term swings. The best thing you can do is not look at your cryptocurrency investment, or “set it and forget it.” As experts continue to tell us each time there’s a price swing — whether up or down — emotional reaction can cause investors to act rashly and make decisions that result in losses on their investment.</h3>The Future of Cryptocurrency</h3>We can speculate on what value cryptocurrency may have for investors in the coming months and years (and many will), but the reality is it’s still a new and speculative investment, without much history on which to base predictions. No matter what a given expert thinks or says, no one really knows. That’s why it’s important to only invest what you’re prepared to lose, and stick to more conventional investments for long-term wealth building. “If you were to wake one morning to find that crypto has been banned by the developed nations and it became worthless, would you be OK?” Frederick Stanield, a CFP with Lifewater Wealth Management in Atlanta, Georgia, told NextAdvisor recently. Keep your investments small, and never put crypto investments above any other financial goals like saving for retirement and paying off high interest debt. `,

    <br/>1. Amazon Book Review
    <br/>
    This book blog topped Scribendi's 2020 list, and it's easy to see why. It's probably the most comprehensive book blog out there for contemporary works, and it covers all kinds of genres. The Editors' Picks seem to have something for everyone.
    All of this booky goodness is presented on a bright, easy-to-navigate website. There are even celebrity picks, where "celebrity" encompasses not only film and TV stars but also athletes, musicians, and authors. I must say that this book blog also tops my list when it comes to what's hot off the press and for its sheer variety.
    
    
    <br/>2. John Pistelli

Take a look at his review index for a ton of books to choose from, each with his thoughtful and artful opinions and musings. He covers novels, nonfiction, poetry, drama, and comics, and he even throws in some commercial fiction for good measure.
    
    What also caught my eye is his "lifetime reading list," which includes titles you'd expect to be recommended by an English professor—but also some surprises.

    title: "Super cars",
    img: "img4.jpg",
    content: `The word supercar is thrown around describing various high performance cars, but only applying to few. This begs the question; what makes a car a supercar? There are many factors that a vehicle must satisfy before it can be considered a supercar. A few of these factors include, performance, brand name, and exclusivity. Performance is made up of three parts: handling, power, and speed. Brand name is important because of  heritage and history. Exclusivity is important because of its rarity, price, and materials used. Supercars have been the pursuit of many companies for over a hundred years, but only few have succeeded.

    There are many factors that make a high performance car deserving of the title, supercar. The biggest factor is performance. Performance is made up of three parts: handling, power, and speed. Handling is how well the vehicle goes around a corner, which depends on the vehicle’s weight and suspension. A lighter vehicle will corner faster than one with heavier weight because centrifugal force which pulls a rotating body away from itself. Suspension is also key because it reduces body roll. Body roll is how the weight of the car transferred from side to side. The heavier the car, the more body roll which in turn, slows the car down. Power is another important factor in becoming a supercar. Power is created by the engine which is then interpreted into horsepower and measured in watts. Horsepower originated for horses pulling power against a steam engine. In  modern times one horsepower is the equivalent to 746 watts. The more power a car has, the higher speed a vehicle can achieve. Speed is one of the most important aspects in a vehicle becoming a supercar. A general rule in a vehicle becoming a supercar is the top speed`,

    title: "Galaxies",
    img: "img5.jpg",
    content: `Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is typical: it has hundreds of billions of stars, enough gas and dust to make billions more stars, and at least ten times as much dark matter as all the stars and gas put together. And it’s all held together by gravity.

    Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the center of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are being generated. Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the astronomers conclude that the center of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole.
    
    Other galaxies have elliptical shapes, and a few have unusual shapes like toothpicks or rings. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) shows this diversity. Hubble observed a tiny patch of sky (one-tenth the diameter of the moon) for one million seconds (11.6 days) and found approximately 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. From the ground, we see very little in this spot, which is in the constellation Fornax.
    <h4>Formation</h4>
    After the Big Bang, the Universe was composed of radiation and subatomic particles. What happened next is up for debate - did small particles slowly team up and gradually form stars, star clusters, and eventually galaxies? Or did the Universe first organize as immense clumps of matter that later subdivided into galaxies?
    
    <h4>Collisions</h4>
    The shapes of galaxies are influenced by their neighbors, and, often, galaxies collide. The Milky Way is itself on a collision course with our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. Even though it is the same age as the Milky Way, Hubble observations reveal that the stars in Andromeda's halo are much younger than those in the Milky Way. From this and other evidence, astronomers infer that Andromeda has already smashed into at least one and maybe several other galaxies.`,

    title: "SpaceX",
    img: "img6.jpg",
    content: `NASA and SpaceX are targeting Tuesday, Dec. 21, at 5:06 a.m. EST for launch of the 24th Commercial Resupply Services mission to the International Space Station. The Dragon spacecraft will lift off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

    Dragon will bring food, supplies, and scientific investigations to the orbiting crew, including a protein crystal growth study that could improve the delivery of cancer treatment drugs and a handheld bioprinter that could one day be used to print tissue directly onto wounds to faster healing.
    
    The spacecraft will arrive at the station on Wednesday, Dec. 22 at approximately 4:30 a.m. and remain docked for about a month before returning to Earth.
    
    The mission will be covered live on NASA TV, the NASA app, and the agency’s website.NASA and SpaceX are continuing plans to launch Crew-3 astronauts to the International Space Station as early as Sunday Oct. 31, and targeting the return home of Crew-2 astronauts in the early-to-mid November timeframe.
    
    <br/><br/>Crew-3 will be the third crew rotation mission with astronauts on an American rocket and spacecraft from the United States to the space station, and the fourth flight with astronauts, including the Demo-2 test flight in 2020, Crew-1 mission in 2020-21, and the ongoing Crew-2 flight as part of the Expedition 65 crew.
    
    The Crew-3 mission will launch NASA astronauts Raja Chari, mission commander, Tom Marshburn, pilot, and Kayla Barron, mission specialist, and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Matthias Maurer, also a mission specialist, aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew is scheduled for a long-duration stay aboard the orbiting laboratory, living and working as part of what is expected to be a seven-member crew.
    
    Crew-3 astronauts plan to arrive at the station to overlap with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA (European Space Agency) astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who flew to the station as part of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-2 mission in April 2021.
    
    Missions teams also are targeting no earlier than April 15, 2022, for the launch of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-4 mission to the space station for a six-month science mission aboard the microgravity laboratory.<br/><br/>
    
    Crew-4 will be commanded by Kjell Lindgren with Bob Hines as pilot, both NASA astronauts. ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will be a mission specialist and command the ISS Expedition 68 crew, while the remaining crew member has yet to be named. Crew-3 astronauts are set to return to Earth in late April 2022 following a similar handover with Crew-4.
    
    NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is working with industry through a public-private partnership to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station, which will allow for additional research time and will increase the opportunity for discovery aboard humanity’s testbed for exploration. The space station remains the springboard to space exploration, including future missions to the Moon and Mars.`,
